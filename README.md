Everand App Mod unlock 12 months free premium subscription with Everand Plus free trial - Every item you equip will enhance some aspect of the game, whether it's resource generation, army power, hero power, etc. To make items, you need to upgrade your headquarters and spend resources - mainly monsters dropped during battles on the world map. The production process is self-evident, but there are a few things to remember: The project can be upgraded (hierarchical). The higher the level, the stronger the item. Raising the headquarters level will bring you new items. The project belongs to a collection; Equipping enough items from a set of equipment can earn additional rewards. As a new player, just focus on filling your equipment slot - you can come back anytime and make it later.
